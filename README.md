## Running Shell from Linux
I am here creating shell scripts here from Virtual box where Ubuntu is installed and running them from the command line.

Set execute permission on the script:
```
chmod +x script-name-here.sh
```
To run your script, enter:
```
./script-name-here.sh
```
To finally check the files with permission:
```
ls -l
```
